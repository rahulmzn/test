The only areas of uncertain timing and amount are technical provisions and the related reinsurance recoverables. The methods for estimating the value of these items is discussed in greater detail in Note 1C (a).2B. Risks arising from insurance contracts  Insurance risk is the risk that fluctuations in claims or premiums impact the income statement. This includes catastrophic events that lead to short-term spikes in claims.As a medium-sized health cash plan provider, the business and hence the insurance risk is concentrated within one country of operations – the UK – and a single sector of insurance – general health insurance. In addition, within this, concentration occurs within the largest group customers. These are companies that have a significant number of their employees as BHSF policyholders and hence are likely to be more concentrated geographically than the general population.The pricing of products is an important factor in managing insurance risk. An actuarial quote engine is used to price many products, with senior executive involvement in other pricing decisions where necessary. The profitability of products is monitored in order to ensure that products do not become unviable and an appropriate level of surplus is being generated to maintain the solvency of the business. Premium and claims levels are monitored on a monthly basis in order to identify trends.The nature of the Group’s core health cash plan business which makes up over 90% of the Group’s premium income is such that claims are of high volume, covering dental or optical appointments and other day-to-day treatments that can be burdensome for individuals but are of relatively low value for the IBISWorld |General Insurance intheUK Nov 20232AboutIBISWorldIBISWorld specializes inindustry research withcoverage onthousands ofglobal industries.

The Group’s in-house insurer, AICL, sits on the motor and home panels and competes for that business with other panel members on equal terms. AICL offers its underwriting capacity on the home panel through a coinsurance deal with a third party, and so the Group takes no underwriting risk for that product. Even if underwritten by a third party, the product is presented as a Saga product and the Group manages the customer relationship.12m to Jan 2023 12m to Jan 2022£mMotorBrokingHomeBrokingOtherBroking Total ChangeMotorBrokingHomeBrokingOtherBroking TotalGross written premiums ( GWP ):Brokered 105.0 150.1 123.9 379.0 6.9% 105.0 153.2 96.5 354.7Underwritten 180.9 – 3.2 184.1 (11.9%) 205.5 – 3.4 208.9GWP 285.9 150.1 127.1 563.1 (0.1%) 310.5 153.2 99.9 563.6Broker revenue 31.4 26.5 42.1 100.0 (5.1%) 43.2 29.0 33.2 105.4Instalment revenue 6.4 3.0 – 9.4 (4.1%) 6.6 3.2 – 9.8Add-on revenue 9.2 10.4 – 19.6 (10.5%) 11.0 10.9 – 21.9Other revenue 26.1 17.7 3.2 47.0 0.9% 27.4 17.1 2.1 46.6Written revenue 73.1 57.6 45.3 176.0 (4.2%) 88.2 60.2 35.3 183.7Written gross profit 70.4 57.6 48.6 176.6 (2.6%) 85.6 60.2 35.6 181.4Marketing expenses (13.0) (6.7) (5.5) (25.2) 10.6% (17.5) (7.1) (3.6) (28.2)Written gross profit after marketing expenses 57.4 50.9 43.1 151.4 (1.2%) 68.1 53.1 32.0 153.2Other operating expenses (39.3) (28.4) (16.0) (83.7) 3.3% (38.0) (27.9) (20.7) (86.6)Written Underlying Profit Before Tax ( PBT )918.1 22.5 27.1 67.7 1.7% 30.1 25.2 11.3 66.6Written to earned adjustment 1.4 – – 1.4 800.0% (0.2) – – (0.2)Earned Underlying PBT919.5 22.5 27.1 69.1 4.1% 29.9 25.2 11.3 66.4Policies in force 800k 645k 207k 1,652k (2.5%) 884k 682k 129k 1,695kPolicies sold 849k 670k 206k 1,725k (2.4%) 943k 696k 129k 1,768kThird-party panel share1032.7% 2.6ppts 30.1%Insurance encompasses our Motor, Home and Other Broking operations and our in-house Insurance Underwriting business.Insurance9 Refer to the Alternative Performance Measures Glossary on page 209 for definition and explanation10 Third-party underwriter’s share of the motor panel for policiesStrategic report Financial statements Additional information GovernanceSaga plial resources over a period of 14 months from the date of signing these financial statements, a period which includes the maturity of £150m of senior bonds in May 2024. This assessment is based on higher and lower case financial projections which incorporate scenario analysis and stress tests on expected business performance.The Group’s higher case modelling assumes good performance in the Cruise division in 2023/24, on the back of strong booked load factors and per diems. Travel is also expected to achieve continued growth in revenues with encouraging bookings for 2023/24 as at the end of March 2023. As previously indicated, the outlook for Insurance is likely to be challenging over the next 12 to 18 months, with high cost and claims inflation in a competitive market expected to squeeze margins.

The carrying value of goodwill by CGU is as follows: 2023  £m 2022  £m Insurance 449.6 718.6  449.6 718.6 The Group tests all goodwill balances for impairment at least annually, and twice-yearly if indicators of impairment exist at the interim reporting date of 31 July. The impairment test compares the recoverable amount of each CGU to the carrying value of its net assets including the value of the allocated goodwill.On 1 January 2022, new pricing rules arising from the implementation of recommendations included in the FCA’s GIPP market study came into effect. As a result, and against the background of a highly competitive motor insurance market, the Group saw a fall in policy volumes in the period to 31 July 2022 and year to 31 January 2023, with a consequential adverse impact on the profitability of the Insurance business. Management considered this to be an indicator of impairment and therefore conducted full impairment reviews of the Insurance CGU as at 31 July 2022 and 31 January 2023.The recoverable amount of the Insurance CGU has been determined based on a value-in-use calculation using nominal cash flow projections from the Group’s latest five-year financial forecasts to 2027/28, which are derived using past experience of the Group’s trading, combined with the anticipated impact of changes in macroeconomic and regulatory factors. A terminal value has been calculated using the Gordon Growth Model based on the fifth year of those projections and an annual growth rate of 2.0% (July 2022: 2.0%; January 2022: 2.0%) as the expected long-term average nominal growth rate of the UK economy. The cash flows have then been discounted to present value  using a suitably risk-adjusted nominal discount rate based on a market-participant view of the cost of capital and debt relevant to the insurance industry.As at 31 January 2023, the pre-tax discount rate used for the Insurance CGU was 13.0% (July 2022: 12.7%; January 2022: 11.5%). The Group’s five-year financial forecasts incorporate the modelled impact of the new pricing rules and the estimated impact this will likely have on future new business pricing and retention rates.

This could be for a number of reasons, including weather-related events, large individual claims, changes in claimant behaviour patterns such as increased levels of fraudulent activities, the use of PPOs, prospective or retrospective legislative changes, unresponsive and inaccurate pricing or reserving methodologies and the deterioration in the Group’s ability to effectively and efficiently handle claims while delivering excellent customer service. The Group manages insurance risk within its risk management framework as set out by the Board. The key policies and processes of mitigating these risks have been implemented, which include underwriting partnership arrangements, reinsurance excess of loss contracts, pricing policies and claims management, and administration policies. i) Underwriting and pricing risk The Group primarily underwrites motor insurance for private cars in the UK. The book consists of a large number of individual risks which are widely spread geographically, which helps to minimise concentration risk. The Group has controls in place to restrict access to its products to only those risks that it wishes to underwrite. The Group has management information to allow it to monitor underwriting performance on a continuous basis and the ability to make pricing and underwriting changes quickly. The Group undertakes detailed statistical analysis of underwriting experience for each rating factor and combination of rating factors, to enable it to adjust pricing for emerging trends.ii) Reserving riskReserving risk is the risk that insufficient funds have been set aside to settle claims as they fall due. The Group undertakes regular internal actuarial reviews and commissions exter
