        "{\"industry\":\"General Insurance\",\"industry-outlook\":\"The General Insurance industry in the UK is expected to see revenue grow at a compound annual rate of 1.6% over the five years through 2023-24 to reach £75.6 billion. After Solvency II regulations were brought in at the start of 2016, buffer requirements constricted capital. More recently, the COVID-19 outbreak brought about huge disruption to insurance patterns and claims, with some lines (like car insurance) becoming considerably more profitable, while the opposite is true for others (like income protection).\n\nFollowing a solid recovery in 2021-22, the Russian invasion of Ukraine created yet more chaos in the insurance sector, especially for aviation and maritime insurance – these have been pressured by war-related risks and nervous reinsurers. At the same time, insurers have contended with claims inflation, particularly in the home and motor markets, threatening profitability. This has sparked concerns from the Bank of England regarding solvency coverage and whether insurers have adequate capital reserves. All the same, revenue is estimated to rise by 2.6% in 2023-24, while the average industry profit margin is expected to be 8.3%.\n\nOver the five years through 2028-29, revenue is set to grow at a compound annual rate of 3.6% to reach £90.2 billion, while profit is expected to climb to 10.2% of revenue. Claims inflation will remain a bone of contention for insurers, prompting further price hikes and hurting demand. However, changes to the regulatory climate under the Solvency UK regulations will free up capital in the future. Climate change poses a slow-moving but increasing threat as erratic weather conditions boost claim costs."
